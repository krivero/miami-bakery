            Miami Bakery’s roots are in the beautiful
            <br>
            Caribbean city of Havana, Cuba.

          It was by 1956 that Rigoberto Marrero established his first bakery named “El Recreo” located in the famous Paradero de la Vivora.
          What set him apart from the rest was that his personal farm in Rancho Bollero produced the fresh guava that would go into his famous guava pastelitos.

          What set him apart from the rest was that his personal farm in Rancho Bollero produced the fresh guava that would go into his famous guava pastelitos.
          Business was booming and 2 years later he opened a second bakery named “El Arco de Belen” in La Habana Vieja.
          <br>
          Rigoberto was a people person and would personally deliver his wholesale products to his customers in his station wagon.

          Like many Cubans, Rigoberto and his family did not think that the Cuban Revolution would last and so it was not until 1971 that they immigrated to Miami, FL. He had big dreams and knew he ultimately wanted to open his own bakery in the states, so he worked at Camaguey Bakery in Hialeah to save enough money to do so.
          <br>
          <br>
          By 1973, 2 years after arriving in the United States, Rigoberto saved enough money to purchase his own bakery, which was on the very busy 49th Street in Hialeah. Being a businessman, he outgrew several bakeries throughout the years selling for a profit every time.

          In 1992 Miami Bakery was established and has been family owned and operated ever since.
          <br>
          In 2004 Miami Bakery established itself on the infamous Allapattah neighborhood corner of NW 20th Street and 22nd Avenue, also known as “El Camello.”
          <br>
          Since then, the third generation of bakers has joined the family business bringing in new ideas and looking to propel Miami Bakery into the future and for many generations to come.
